        </br></br>"Do you sometimes feel like you are stuck in an endless black tunnel? Like you are the only one left behind while the whole world around you are moving forward at an extremely rapid speed? I mean, I do agree that every choice I ever made led to where I am right now. It is no one else but my responsibility; no one owes my nothing. But I just do not want to continue wandering aimlessly on this path. Would it be easier...that everything just restarts?" </br></br>

                The snow had been on for a whole day. Very few pedestrians were on the road, and most stores were closed because of the snowstorm warning. After having these conversations so many times with herself, Lia eventually decided to ditch the lecture at school tonight and get a fortune reading instead. </br></br>
                
                "I knew you would be coming tonight, young lady. Come to pick a tarot card." </br></br>
                
                Lia hesitated for a moment and reached out to pick a card that was tilted slightly to the right from the spreading pile. </br></br>
                
                "A naked woman floats above the Earth holding a short scepter in each hand, circled by a wreath, with the one creature at each corner of the card, a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. This card is 'the World'." </br></br>
                
                "The World?" </br></br>
                
                "Yes, and it is open for your interpretation. Good night, young lady. The snow outside is not going to stop for a while. So, make sure you keep warm on your way home." The lady in black put out the candles on the table as she said. </br></br>
                
                Lia was still found fairly confused when she walked home. The road was completely covered by heavy snow, and she could barely move her feet among the snowdrifts. She felt her legs getting heavier and heavier. And her arms did it too, and her hands, and her eyes...She watched her body slowly collapse, falling into a snowdrift, and then soon was covered by snowfall little by little. Within a blink, her body had been fully blanked by the white and seemed to vanish in the inky night. Lia just stood there and watched it happen like it was someone else. But Lia clearly knew it was her. Just a moment ago, silently, a young woman who had been called Lia for 19 years, vanished forever. </br></br>
                
                "But what am I now? How can it even be possible for me to witness my death?" Lia extended her hand and tried to touch her face. The face was almost numb in the bitter cold, but she could still sense the gentle touch and the slight sting brought by the rough skin of her fingertip. "I have to go home." Lia picked up her pace. </br></br>
                
                "Ow!" Lia bumped into a couple. The male wore a long black trench coat, and the female was also wrapped in a black down jacket. </br></br>
                
                “We must get to school to pick up her before the road is completely closed due to the heavy snow.” “Bloody weather!” “Hurry up!” </br></br>
                
                Lia was about to greet them, but they just passed by in a rush. "They look really familiar." Lia thought to herself. Suddenly, she sensed a warm wind blowing on her left face. She looked up to her left; there was a small house with a glimmer of warm yellow light coming through the translucent glass windows. “Readings from the Oasis!” she soon realized that this was the last store she went to before she died, “I still don’t know what is ‘the World’! I need to ask the lady in black.” Without hesitation, Lia quickly pushed the door open. </br></br>
                
                The lady in black greeted her with a smile. “I knew you would be visiting again, young lady. How have you been?” </br></br>
                
                “For everything that is happening right now, I cannot understand at all. But would you tell me what is ‘the World’?” </br></br>
                
                “It means the dawn at the end of the tunnel. When you see a dawn, even if you have not quite reached this point of completion, you are just very very close. Closer than you think it is. In the very near future, you finally accomplish your goal and purpose. Everything has come together, and you are in the right place, doing the right thing, and achieving what you have long envisioned.” The lady in black handed the tarot card to Lia, “My child, it means REBIRTH.” </br></br>
                
                What direction life will take me in remains unknown, but it no longer feels endless anymore. It will end when it ends. I still exist because there is someone in this world who remembers me. Stepping out of the wooden door of the fortune telling store, Lia never felt the sunlight has never been so dazzling and warm. </br></br>

        </br></br>"你是否有时觉得自己被困在一个无尽的黑色隧道里？就像你是唯一被甩在后面的人，而你周围的整个世界都在以极快的速度前行？我想，我同意，我过去所做的每一项选择都导致了我的限制。这无关他人，而是我的责任；没有人亏欠我什么。但我只是不想继续在这条路上继续漫无目的地徘徊。如果一切重新开始…会更简单吗？"</br></br>

        雪已经下了整整一天了。路上的行人很少，大多数商店也都因为暴雪警告而关闭了。在与自己进行了无数次这样的对话后，利亚最终决定放弃今晚在学校的讲座，而去找人算命。</br></br>
        
        "我知道你今晚会来，年轻的女士。请选一张塔罗牌。"</br></br>
        
        利亚犹豫了一会儿，伸手从摊开的牌堆中挑了一张微微向右倾斜的牌。</br></br>
        
        "一个赤身裸体的女人漂浮在土地之上，两只手各拿着一根短权杖，她的周身被一个花环环绕，牌的四角各有一个生物，一个人，一头狮子，一头牛，一只鹰。这张牌是'世界'。"</br></br>
        
        "世界？"</br></br>
        
        "是的，它的寓意开放于你解释。晚安，年轻的女士。外面的雪一时半会是不会停了。所以，在回家的路上请一定要注意保暖。" 黑衣女士边说边熄灭了桌子上的蜡烛。</br></br>
        
        利亚走在回家的路上时，仍然感到相当困惑。道路已被大雪完全覆盖，她几乎无法在厚重的雪堆中移动她的步伐。她感到她的腿越来越重。她的手臂也是如此，还有她的手，还有她的眼睛......她看着自己的身体缓缓倒下，落入雪堆中，然后很快被降雪一点一点地覆盖。一眨眼间，她的身体已经完全被白色覆盖，似乎消失在墨色的夜里。利亚却只是站在那里，看着这一切的发生，好像是在看别人。但利亚清楚地知道那是她。就在刚才，无声无息地，一个被称为了利亚19年的年轻女子，永远地消失了。</br></br>
        
        "那我现在是什么？为什么我能见证我自己的死亡？" 利亚伸出手，试图触摸自己的脸。她的脸在刺骨的寒冷中几乎麻木了，但她仍能感觉到轻柔的触碰与指尖粗糙皮肤划过带来的轻微刺痛感。"我得回家了。" 利亚加快了步伐。</br></br>
        
        "嗷！" 利亚撞上了一对夫妇。男士穿了一件黑色长风衣，女士也裹着一件黑色羽绒服。</br></br>
        
        "我们必须在大雪导致道路完全封闭之前赶到学校去接她。" "该死的天气！" "快点！"</br></br>
        
        利亚正准备和他们打招呼，但他们却在她身边匆匆而过。"他们看起来真的很眼熟。" 利亚心想。突然，她感觉到一股暖风吹拂着她的左脸。她抬头向左看去；那里有一间小屋子，它半透明的玻璃窗间透出一丝丝暖黄色的光。"绿洲占卜！"她很快意识到这是她死前去的最后一间店，"我还是不知道什么是'世界'！我不知道。我需要找黑衣女士问清楚。" 没有一丝犹豫，利亚迅速推开了门。</br></br>
        
        黑衣女士微笑着向她打招呼。"我知道你会再次来访，年轻的女士。你感到怎么样？" </br></br>
        
        "对于现在发生的一切，我完全不能理解。但你能告诉我什么是'世界'吗？"</br></br>
        
        "它意味着隧道尽头的曙光。当你看到曙光时，即使你还没有完全达到终点，你也已经非常非常接近了。甚至比你认为的还要近。在不远的将来，你终于完成了你的目标。一切都归于圆满，你在对的地方，做对的事，你长期以来的愿景终于实现。" 黑衣女士将塔罗牌递给利亚，"我的孩子，这意味着重生。"</br></br>
        
        生活将把我带往何处仍是个未知数，但它不再感到无穷无尽。当它结束时，它就会结束。我仍然存在，是因为在这个世界上还有人记得我。走出算命小店的木门，利亚从未感觉到太阳是如此耀眼和温暖。</br></br>
